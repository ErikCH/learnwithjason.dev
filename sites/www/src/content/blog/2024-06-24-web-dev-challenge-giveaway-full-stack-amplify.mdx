## We’re giving away a dream desk setup!

In every episode of [_Web Dev Challenge_](https://lwj.dev/wdc), developers from around the community challenge themselves to build an app that meets a prompt and uses a given tool.

Now you can be one of those devs! **Build your own take on the app prompt and submit it to the showcase** to learn something new, show off your work, have some fun with the web dev community, and learn (or practice) practical skills.

And, as a bonus, **one dev will win a dream desk setup**: [Ugmonk's complete Gather collection](https://ugmonk.com/collections/the-gather-collection/products/the-complete-gather-collection-black-maple?variant=42601772220566).

**Please note:** while anyone can participate, only US residents are eligible to win the desk setup at this time. We're exploring the legal requirements of opening up the giveaway to more countries in future giveaways, but this stuff is _complicated_. Thanks for your understanding.

If you're looking for others who are getting involved, we've set up a dedicated channel in the [Learn With Jason Discord](https://lwj.dev/discord) (called `#builder-chat`) for people to brainstorm, share ideas, and keep each other accountable.

Happy building! Let's have some fun. <Heart />
